# The session's database

This section binds the workflow rules' shared-state obligations to this project's database. Where those rules state an end state, this one names the service and the operations that reach it; it restates no obligation they already carry.

## The database is real, and it is running

This project runs its database in a container, continuously. Integration tests run against it — not against a double, an in-memory substitute, or a different engine that is easier to reach from a working tree. A test that proves the code works against something other than the database production uses has proved something else.

Check the running containers before concluding that the database, or the container runtime, is unavailable. That conclusion has been reached and been wrong, in a session whose container was up and serving the whole time.

## What is isolated is the database, not the server

Every session shares the running server and takes **its own database** within it, named after its working tree in whatever form this project's naming constraints impose. The suite writes freely and issues at least one unscoped delete, so two sessions in one database produce failures that read as defects in the change under test and are not.

Do not stand up a second server, do not work in the development database this project's own compose file names, and do not work in another session's.

## Provisioning this session's database

A working tree carries tracked files only, and the environment files naming a database are ignored — so `git worktree add` brings none. Before relying on any verification result: write this working tree's environment file, taking the connection string from the main checkout and pointing it at this working tree's own database; install dependencies; create that database, or reset it where one already exists under that name, since a removed working tree leaves its database behind; and bring it to the project's initial state.

**Migrating is not seeding.** Run this project's seed step as well as its migrations. A database carrying only the schema fails tests that say so in their own assertion messages.

Read a failing test's assertion message before concluding a failure is pre-existing. It usually names the provisioning step that was missed, and "pre-existing failure" has been the wrong answer every time it has been given.

Removing a working tree does not drop the database it used, and nothing here reclaims one.
