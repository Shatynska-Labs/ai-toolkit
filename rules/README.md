# rules/

Memory fragments live at `rules/<rule-name>.md`, flat, directly under this directory.

Rules have no dedicated Claude Code primitive — nothing loads `rules/` automatically the way `skills/` and `agents/` are loaded. That does not mean they are absent from an installed copy: plugin installation copies this repository's entire tree, so these files are present and readable wherever the plugin is installed. Two paths reach a fragment from there:

- **`@` import** — referencing a fragment from a project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, for example `@~/projects/shatynska/ai-toolkit/rules/<rule-name>.md`. This requires no tooling and no copying, and the fragment stays a single source of truth rather than being duplicated into the importing project. The import path is machine-local: it resolves only on a machine where this repository is checked out at that path. An import committed to a repository shared with other people resolves only for people with this library at the same path.
- **A shipped tool reading it** — an executable under `scripts/` locates a fragment relative to its own installed location and reads it directly, with no `@` import and no harness involved. `scripts/project-init` does this: it inlines `development-workflow.md` into a project's `AGENTS.md`.

Both paths reach any fragment under `rules/`, a binding fragment such as `rules/development-workflow-database.md` included. What a binding fragment lacks until tooling catches up is not a route but a *tool* route: it is imported or copied by hand, where the workflow fragment is written into a managed block.

## Fragment kind

Every fragment declares its kind in YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
kind: standing-constraint    # or: procedural-checklist
version: 1                   # only if the fragment is inlined, now or later
---
```

A **standing constraint** is intended to reach a project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` and remain in force there, by either path above. A **procedural checklist** describes a one-time procedure, read on demand, and is never inlined into a project's conventions file — inlining it would leave permanent instructions for work already finished. `version` increments when the fragment's **body** changes — the text a project actually inlines — and not for an edit confined to the frontmatter itself; it has no relationship to the plugin's own version. The obligation is owned by `project-bootstrap`'s requirement "The fragment's version increments when its body changes"; `toolkit-structure` fixes the frontmatter's form and defers that condition to it.
