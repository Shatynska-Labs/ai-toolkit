# ai-toolkit conventions

This repository is a library of reusable agent assets — skills, subagents, and rule fragments — packaged as a Claude Code plugin so it can be installed into any project without copying files. These are the conventions for authoring in this repository.

## Layout

Every asset type sits at exactly one directory level, with no grouping subdirectories:

- `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- `agents/<agent-name>.md`
- `rules/<rule-name>.md`

This is a constraint, not a preference. Skill discovery scans `skills/` for subdirectories that directly contain a `SKILL.md` and descends no further — a `SKILL.md` placed any deeper is never found, and nothing reports the omission. Agent discovery does walk subdirectories, but folds them into the invocation name as `plugin:subdir:agent-name` — a subdirectory would make an agent's name encode a grouping decision, so revising the grouping later renames the agent and breaks every reference to it. Rules are constrained by neither fact but take the same flat shape for consistency.

A skill's directory name is its invocation name. A `name` in the frontmatter that differs from the directory is ignored at load time with no error, so the two must match.

Because every directory is flat, names must be unique within their own directory — the filesystem enforces this.

## Reaching a project

Assets reach a consuming project by installing this repository as a plugin (`/plugin marketplace add`, then `/plugin install`) — not by copying files.

`rules/` fragments have no dedicated Claude Code primitive, so nothing loads them automatically the way `skills/` and `agents/` are loaded. That does not mean they are absent from an installed copy: plugin installation copies this repository's entire tree, not only the directories backing a primitive, so `rules/` is present and readable wherever the plugin is installed — it just has no automatic loader. Two paths reach a fragment from there:

- **`@` import** — a project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` names the fragment's path in this repository (e.g. `@~/projects/shatynska/ai-toolkit/rules/<rule-name>.md`). Needs no tooling, but the path is machine-local — it resolves only where this repository is checked out at that path.
- **A shipped tool reading it** — an executable under `scripts/` locates a fragment relative to its own installed location and reads it directly, with no import and no harness involved. `scripts/project-init` does this: it writes each fragment `rules/manifest` lists as a managed block into the `AGENTS.md` the manifest names — the workflow into the project's own, the backlog's and the workstreams' rules into `docs/backlog/` and `docs/workstreams/`, each beside a `CLAUDE.md` importing it. `scripts/project-update` reads the same fragments to bring a project's blocks current: it replaces an older block nobody edited, reports an edited one without overwriting it, and converts the shapes before `1.0.0` once.

Both reach any fragment under `rules/`. What a binding fragment such as `rules/development-workflow-database.md` lacks until tooling catches up is a *tool* route, not a route: it is imported or copied by hand rather than written into a managed block.

A `rules/` fragment is one of two kinds, declared in its own YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
kind: standing-constraint    # or: procedural-checklist
version: 1.0.0               # only if the fragment is inlined, now or later: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
---
```

A **standing constraint** is meant to reach a project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` and remain in force there — by either path above. A **procedural checklist** describes a one-time procedure, read on demand, and is never inlined into a project's conventions file — inlining it would leave permanent instructions for work already finished.

## Markdown prose is not hard-wrapped

Prose in this repository's markdown is written one paragraph per line, not wrapped at a column. A wrapped paragraph makes every later edit reflow the lines around it, so an edit and a reflow become indistinguishable in the diff — which is the property one-line-per-paragraph keeps.

This binds prose. Frontmatter, code blocks, tables and link-reference definitions are untouched by it, and a list item is one line per item on the same reasoning.

## Tags

`metadata.tags` is the only classification an asset carries: a list of free-form, lowercase kebab-case labels. Multi-valued, and structurally inert — no directory or name depends on it.

Before coining a new tag, check the vocabulary already in use. Free-form tags accumulate synonyms (`git`, `vcs`, `version-control`) with nothing to make the drift visible, so reusing an existing tag over a new one is the only thing keeping the vocabulary coherent.

## What this file does not cover

This file states conventions, not authoring standards. How to write a skill well — the frontmatter contract, description criteria, review checkpoints — lives with the skill that enforces it, not here: see `skills/create-skill/SKILL.md`. The equivalent standard for an agent — the reconciled frontmatter contract, the system-prompt requirements for a fresh-context subprocess, and the trigger and cold-run checks — lives at `skills/create-agent/SKILL.md`.

## Three categories, not two

- **Library assets** — `skills/`, `agents/`, and `rules/`. What ships in the plugin and is the library's substance.
- **Shipped tooling** — `scripts/`. Executables that ship with the library and are runnable directly, by a consumer, a shell, or an agent of any harness — without any harness-specific loading mechanism. `scripts/` conventionally names a repository's *internal* helpers in most projects; here it does not. Its contents ship and are meant to be run by consumers, exactly like `skills/` and `agents/` — they are simply not discovered by description the way those are, and carry no asset frontmatter. Belongs there: a deterministic operation with exactly one correct outcome, meant to be run directly rather than orchestrated by a model. Code needed by only one skill, that no other consumer invokes, stays inside that skill's own `scripts/` directory instead.
- **Repository tooling** — `.claude/`. This repository's own working configuration — the OpenSpec skills and commands used to develop this repository — and tooling meant only for working *on* this repository, never on a consuming project. Not part of the library, never shipped as a library asset.

Every rule text a shipped tool writes into a project is a `rules/` fragment, written as a managed block without its frontmatter, and `rules/manifest` lists which fragments are written and into which `AGENTS.md`. A rule text kept anywhere else would be one no update could reach, since an update replaces what the manifest lists. What a tool writes once and the project then owns — the ignore file, and the one line `@AGENTS.md` in a seeded directory's `CLAUDE.md` — is not a rule text and stays in the tool. A fragment's `version` is a semantic version: a patch changes wording only, a minor changes an obligation that needs no edit in the project, and a major asks the project to do something by hand.

An asset meant to ship belongs in `skills/`, `agents/`, `rules/`, or `scripts/` — never under `.claude/`, which a project installing this plugin never sees.

`tests/` holds a dependency-free harness exercising `scripts/`. Running the tests may require the external commands that tooling itself drives (`git`, `openspec`); *using* the library never requires anything installed. `tests/` introduces no dependency manifest and no build step — the library remains usable from a clone with nothing installed.
