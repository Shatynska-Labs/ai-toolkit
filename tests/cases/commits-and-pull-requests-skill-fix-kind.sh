# Read over the skill's text (SKILL.md's body and references/), from the lines
# naming a fix (the word "fix", not "prefix" — DERIVED selector). Each scan is
# satisfied by any one selected line, not necessarily the same one; where the
# skill states the fix kind as a heading followed by list items that do not
# repeat the word, the scans miss them — a weakness recorded in test-plan.md.

# --- Local arrangement, declared in this file on purpose -------------------
# A line scanner over a text, with a fixture-driven discriminator. The shared
# arrangement (tests/lib.sh) holds no scanner that can be run over a fixture
# and observed to fail without ending the case. Similar machinery lives in
# tests/cases/lib/line-scan.sh and tests/cases/lib/static-scan.sh, which are
# test modules, not shared arrangement, so neither is sourced. Recorded under
# "Missing shared arrangement" in describe-commits-and-pull-requests's
