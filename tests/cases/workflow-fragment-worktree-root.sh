# Scenario (mechanical half only): A recursive tool does not descend into
# sibling working trees.
#
# The requirement fixes the working-tree root rather than leaving it to the
# fragment's author — "a fixed path within the repository — `.worktrees/`,
# one directory per working tree" — for the stated reason that an obligation
# checked against a path is uncheckable where the path is left to choice.
# Asserting the root verbatim is what that reason buys, and it is the half a
# shell case can reach.
#
# The path must also be harness-neutral: where a harness creates working
# trees at a path of its own, that path is named *beneath* the rule, as that
# harness's binding. Order is one of the few properties of prose a case can
# observe, so it is asserted here rather than left to reading.
#
# Not asserted: that the containment obligations — the ignore entry, and
# scoping every recursive tool that does not read it — are absent from the
# fragment. The same requirement moves them to the capability that owns
# project setup, but no lexical rule separates a stated obligation from a
# mention of one. Verified by reading.
#
# This case follows the normative sentence — the one that says what the
# fragment SHALL name. Two back-references in the backlog requirement
# once cited the harness path instead; both now cite `.worktrees/`, so the
# conflict this comment recorded no longer exists.
