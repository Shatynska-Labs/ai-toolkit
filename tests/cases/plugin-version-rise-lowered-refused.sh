# Scenario: A lowered version is refused
# Requirement: The plugin's version rises with what it ships.
# Change: raise-the-plugin-version-on-release (toolkit-structure, ADDED).
#
# SPECIFIED: a version numerically below the one where the branch left the
# trunk fails, whatever else the diff changes.
# DERIVED (operationalisation): "numerically" is shown by 1.10.0 and 1.9.0,
# which compare the other way as text.

# Runs the check in tests/cases/lib/plugin-version-rise.sh over fixture
# repositories. Green at authoring: the check is written in this pass, so the
# refusals and the passes beside them are what establish it discriminates.
# shellcheck disable=SC1090,SC1091 # both paths are set by tests/run.sh at runtime, not statically resolvable
