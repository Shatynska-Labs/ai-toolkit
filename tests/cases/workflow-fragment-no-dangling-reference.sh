# Scenario (mechanical half only): A reader of a project's conventions finds
# no dangling reference.
#
# In a consuming project the conventions file holds a copy of the fragment's
# body and no rules/ directory is read, so a sentence naming a `rules/` path,
# a fragment file, or an `@` import names something the reader cannot open.
# The rule binds the binding fragment as well as the workflow one.
#
# Only the naming half is asserted. That every *other* reference resolves
# within the document — a section cross-reference, a named artifact the
# project holds — is a property of the prose and is verified by reading
# (tasks 1.16, 2.4). So is the positive half of the same requirement: that
# the workflow fragment refers to the binding as an adjacent section of the
# same conventions file, conditioned on the project carrying it. No lexical
# rule separates that sentence from any other.
# shellcheck disable=SC1090 # $TESTLIB is set by tests/run.sh at runtime, not statically resolvable
