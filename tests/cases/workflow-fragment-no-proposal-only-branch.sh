# Scenario (mechanical half only): An opened-and-left branch does not become
# the session's working branch.
#
# The branch a session opens for a change it identified but will not work on
# carries a `handoff.md` and no proposal, "so it is not named for a proposal
# — the term this requirement's predecessor used, and the one this change
# replaces". The predecessor's own scenario was titled for that term, and its
# rules called the thing a *proposal-only branch* throughout; this change
# renames both the artifact and the branch that carries it.
#
# The half a case can reach is the name. It is SPECIFIED — the requirement
# states outright which term is replaced — and it is an absence rather than a
# presence, because the replacement term is "a branch of its own", which is
# ordinary English no scan can distinguish from any other use of it.
#
# A fragment naming the branch for a proposal while placing a handoff on it
# is the half-applied rename, and it reinstates exactly the reading the
# handoff decision exists to prevent: that what sits on that branch is a
# proposal in draft, to be reviewed rather than read.
#
# Not asserted: that the branch is created and left, that it takes no working
# tree, and that it does not become the branch this session works on. All
# three are session behavior, verified by reading (task 1.15).
