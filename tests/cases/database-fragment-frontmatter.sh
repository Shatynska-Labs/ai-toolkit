# Accounts for no scenario of its own. The removed requirement withholding a
# `version` from a session-scoped fragment states in its migration that the
# binding fragment declares `kind: standing-constraint` and a `version` —
# permitted rather than owed until the queued tooling change inlines it, and
# owed from then. This case fixes that frontmatter now, so the interval is
# the bounded one the migration names rather than an unmarked file.
#
# Also asserts the flat layout AGENTS.md requires. Nothing reports a
# misplaced fragment at load time, so a case is the only thing that would.
