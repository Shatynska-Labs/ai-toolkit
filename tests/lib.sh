# Reads the `version:` from a toolkit's workflow rule fragment, mirroring the
# parse in scripts/project-init. Cases assert against this rather than a
# literal, so that editing the fragment does not break a case for a reason
# unrelated to what it tests. Defaults to the toolkit under test; pass a root
# to read a decoy's fragment instead.

# Returns non-zero rather than exiting. Every call site is a command
# substitution, and an `exit` inside `$( )` ends only the subshell — the
# caller would carry on with an empty version, degrading its assertions to
# ones that pass against anything. Callers MUST therefore write:
#
#   version="$(fragment_version)" || exit 1
#
# so the failure reaches the case itself. `|| exit 1` is not optional
# defensiveness here; without it the guard below is unreachable.
