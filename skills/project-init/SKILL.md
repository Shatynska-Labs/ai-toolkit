  This skill should be used when the user wants to initialize a new project
  into this repository's development workflow, or adopt that workflow in an
  existing project — "set up a new project", "initialize this repo",
  "bootstrap this project for spec-driven development", "adopt this
  workflow here", "run project-init". It resolves the ai-toolkit toolkit
  root, invokes the deterministic `scripts/project-init` tool, relays its
  report verbatim, offers an initial commit, and names foundation discovery
  as the next step without starting it. It performs only deterministic
  setup — Git, OpenSpec, a seeded `docs/backlog.md`, a managed workflow
  block in `AGENTS.md` — and makes no judgment about the project's
  identity, scope, or architecture;
  for those, see `project-foundation`, which it never invokes itself. Not
  for authoring library assets (`create-skill`, `create-agent`) and not for
  proposing an OpenSpec change once a project already has a foundation
  (`openspec-explore`, `openspec-propose`).

# project-init

A thin wrapper around `scripts/project-init`. Every decision belongs to that script; this skill's job is to find it, run it, relay what it says, and stop.

## 1. Resolve the toolkit root

Try, in order, stopping at the first that resolves:

1. `$AI_TOOLKIT_ROOT`
2. `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`
3. the machine-local default, `~/projects/ai-toolkit`

If none resolves, report yourself blocked — name what you looked for — and stop. Do not fall back to running `git init` or `openspec init` directly, and do not write the workflow rules from memory. An improvised equivalent produces a project initialized differently from every other one while looking like it succeeded, which is the exact failure this workflow exists to prevent.

## 2. Invoke the tool

Run it through its interpreter, never as a bare path:

```
bash "<resolved-root>/scripts/project-init" [--tools <value>] [TARGET_DIR]
```

Pass through whatever the user specified (a `--tools` value, a target directory other than the current one). Do not parse or second-guess the tool's internal logic — it owns every decision about what gets created, skipped, or reported.

## 3. Relay the report

Show the user what the tool printed — target directory, each concern and its outcome, the terminal outcome, and the next step. Do not summarize away detail the report considered worth stating (an import line the user needs to add, a version mismatch in an existing managed block, files a delegated command wrote).

If the tool reported `BLOCKED` or `ERROR`, stop here. Explain the reason from the report; do not attempt the failed step yourself.

## 4. Offer a commit, on `SUCCESS` only

Offer to create an initial commit covering what the tool just did. Wait for confirmation — never commit without it, per this workflow's own rule that commits are suggested, not automatic.

## 5. Name the next step; never take it

The tool's report already names the next step. Repeat it back and stop there:

- **New project** — name foundation discovery (`project-foundation`) as available. Do not begin that conversation yourself; starting an open-ended discovery conversation decides that this is the right moment to spend an hour on it, and that decision belongs to the user.
- **Adoption** — the report already states that foundation discovery is available if the project's decisions should be recorded retroactively. Relay that; nothing further is required.

## Trigger check fixtures

- **Positive** — "I'm starting a brand new project, can you set it up with git, openspec, and the usual conventions?" → expected routing: `project-init`.
- **Negative** — "This project already exists — help me figure out what it actually is, its scope, and what tech stack makes sense." → expected routing: `project-foundation`.
