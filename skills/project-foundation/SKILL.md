  This skill should be used when the user wants to establish a new
  project's foundation — its identity, problem, audience, scope,
  non-goals, technology, architecture, testing strategy, and development
  tooling — "let's figure out what this project actually is", "establish
  this project's foundation", "run project-foundation", "define the scope
  and non-goals for this new project", "what should our testing strategy
  be". It wraps the checklist in `rules/project-foundation.md`
  conversationally: elicits decisions that must be supplied, proposes ones
  that may be proposed with reasoning, and writes each into a
  `project-foundation` change's `design.md` as it settles, delegating
  artifact generation to `openspec-propose`. Use only after a project has
  been initialized (see `project-init`, not invoked here). Not for
  authoring library assets (`create-skill`, `create-agent`), and not for a
  change unrelated
  to a project's own foundation.

# project-foundation

The conversational wrapper over `rules/project-foundation.md`. That fragment carries the checklist and the reasoning; this skill carries the conversation and the gate. Read the fragment before starting — it is the source of the nine decisions and their classification, not restated here.

## Converse, don't interrogate

Identity, problem, audience, scope, and non-goals must come from the user — nothing available makes them derivable. Once those are established, propose the technical decisions (language, framework, architecture, testing strategy, development tooling) with your reasoning, for confirmation or redirection — that is faster than asking about them, and it is not a substitute for coverage.

Do not fire the nine decisions as a fixed sequence of questions. Coverage is the obligation; interrogation order is not. The development-tooling items are the same: once the stack is known, propose them as one coherent set with your reasoning, not one question per item. Propose the testing-strategy items with the test runner even when nobody raises them — the shared test arrangement especially, where the project's shared builders, fixtures and doubles live, or that it has none.

## Persist as you go

Create the `project-foundation` change early — dispatch or use `openspec-propose` for the mechanics — and write each decision into its `design.md` as it settles, rather than holding everything in conversation until a final write. The conversation may span sessions; a decision that exists only in this conversation is invisible to whoever resumes it.

`design.md` carries this fixed section layout, exactly as `rules/project-foundation.md` specifies:

```
## Identity
   - What it is
   - Problem it solves
   - Intended audience
## Scope
## Non-Goals
## Technology
## Architecture
## Testing Strategy
   - Test command
   - Test-path glob
   - Shared test arrangement
## Development Tooling
   - Linting
   - Formatting
   - Type checking
   - Build tooling
   - Local hooks
   - Commit messages
   - Secrets
   - Dependency updates and audit
   - Continuous integration
   - Toolchain pinning
   - Branch protection
   - Provisioning
   - Ignore entries
   - Delivery
```

An unfilled section, or an unfilled item within `Identity`, `Testing Strategy` or `Development Tooling`, is a visible gap — that is what makes coverage checkable in the artifact rather than only inside this conversation. An item may be answered "not applicable" with its reason stated; a stated reason is an answer, an empty item is not.

## Also write to README.md and AGENTS.md as decisions settle

`design.md` is archived with the change once foundation completes, so it is not what a human or a fresh agent session reads by default. Alongside each `design.md` write — never instead of it — write the same decision into whichever of the project's `README.md` or `AGENTS.md` it belongs in, per `rules/project-foundation.md`'s "Decisions also reach README.md and AGENTS.md" section: identity, problem, audience, scope, non-goals, technology, and architecture go to `README.md`; testing strategy and development tooling go to a separate, non-managed section of `AGENTS.md` — including the test command, the test-path glob, and the shared test arrangement as a path or that there is none, which a later change's test author is dispatched with. The split follows whether a future agent turn needs the fact without being told to look for it, not which audience happens to value it — do not re-derive the split from scratch here, read it from the fragment.

## Foundation builds the ignore entries, and names who builds the rest

Foundation's one deliverable is the ignore entries: once the stack is known, extend the project's `.gitignore` with that stack's exclusions and its secret-bearing paths. `project-init` deliberately created a `.gitignore` with no stack assumption; this is the first point the stack is known, and this is where that gap closes.

Do not build the rest of the tooling in this change — no linter, formatter, hook, continuous-integration or dependency-update configuration. Before archiving, open the successor change that owns it, with the handoff contents `rules/project-foundation.md` specifies, and name it under `Delivery`; where every decided item is already present, say so under `Delivery` instead. Do not change forge settings either — branch protection is recorded here and applied later, with the operator's confirmation.

## Test authoring does not apply to this change

State this explicitly when the point would normally arrive: this change's test command and test-path glob don't exist yet — they're among its own outputs — so deriving tests from its specification before implementing it is structurally impossible. This exemption applies to the foundation change alone; the next change after it has a defined test command and test-path glob, and test authoring applies normally.

## Completion

Foundation is complete when every section is filled, its successor is opened where one is needed, and the change is archived. That archival is the signal — nothing else needs to track the transition into normal development, and nothing afterward should try to reconcile the project against it. A later architectural or tooling shift is simply a new change.

## Trigger check fixtures

- **Positive** — "This project already exists — help me figure out what it actually is, its scope, and what tech stack makes sense." → expected routing: `project-foundation`.
- **Negative** — "I'm starting a brand new project, can you set it up with git, openspec, and the usual conventions?" → expected routing: `project-init`.
- **Positive** — "what should our CI and linting setup be for this new project?" → expected routing: `project-foundation`.
- **Negative** — "set up husky and eslint in this repo" → expected routing: nothing — it asks to build tooling, not to decide it.
